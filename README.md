# User Guide: Working with John

Welcome to my user guide. I appreciate your time to learn more about me.
This guide is a living document and the content will change over time as I continue to grow as a person.

## Who I am

- Someone with a high capacity "tank" (a store of energy/motivation -> EM)
  - I believe that everyone has a tank that gets drained by exerting effort (physically, mentally, or emotionally)
  - Based on empirical evidence, I believe my tank has a much greater capacity than most people
  - This does not equate to me producing more output than others
    - The amount of EM required for a given task is different between people (ex. if I need to do something I don't like but you do, it will require more EM for me by comparison)
- Hard working
  - I always try to put forth the best effort I can in the given moment or situation
  - That effort is impacted by my levels of EM, so it won't always reflect what I'm capable of
- An ambivert (extroverted introvert)
  - I can appear extremely extroverted and gregarious at times, but this requires high levels of EM
  - I normally recharge my tank by spending time alone or sometimes with close friends or family
  - If I haven't had social interactions for long stretches, I can sometimes recharge my tank with extroverted actions
  - I'm not comfortable with small talk and meeting new people
- Outspoken
  - I believe that it's important that everyone contribute to a shared pool of understanding (esp when making decisions)
  - I feel it's each individual's responsibility to make sure their voices are heard (in their preferred means of communication if possible)
  - To this end, I'm always vocal with my perspective (esp when I'm not the decision maker)
  - Since my preference is verbal communication, I tend to talk a lot
- A husband and father
  - I'm fortunate enough to have 2 girls (11, 7) and 2 boys (9, 5) with a smart and supportive wife (12/31/2022)

## Communication Preferences / Style:

I believe in the importance of transparency in helping to build trust. To provide transparency, I look to openly share my thoughts and opinions, often providing the rationale, perspectives, and/or evidence that support them. I also tend to default to over communication to try and reduce misunderstandings. The following is more specifics into the style and approaches I favor in communication.

### Style

In an effort to limit misunderstandings or relying poor assumptions, I tend to use the following styles of communication:

- Succinct and organized. Blaise Pascal is quoted as saying "I would have written you a shorter letter, but I didn't have the time", to capture the sentiment that being succinct requires more effort than "stream of consiousness" styles of communication. I believe this effort is worth it.
  - I try to be as clear and concise as possible, with an emphasis on using proper terms and vocabulary
  - I use lots of numbered (if order is important or the information will be repeatedly referenced) or bullet point lists to structure the content
  - I'll create acronyms / abbreviations for repeated reference
  - I use "()" to co-locate context information that can be skimmed/skipped on re-reads
  - I often provide TL;DR summations (even in conversations) so you can orient yourself to the content or quickly refresh your memory
  - I view the effort I expend into being succint and organized as a sign of my respect for your time
- Direct

### Methods

My preference for how to communicate can vary depending on the situation, but in general the following is a list of communication methods (in preference priority order)

1. [Sync] - Face-to-face
2. [Sync] - Video call (camera on)
3. [Sync] - Video call (camera off)
4. [Async] - Slack/Discord message
5. [Async] - Text
6. [Async] - Email

#### Situational change

For very important information that could also include strong opinions/emotions (ex. giving or receiving feedback), I like to:

- Write or receive an async message - so I'm given more time to think through the content
- Also have a sync discussion - to ensure there's no misunderstandings and/or share information that shouldn't be in writing
  I usually prefer the async message is provided prior the the sync discussion, and in those instances I look to followup with another async message (capturing any changes or decisions)

I will use only async communication if:

- It's just sharing information (no need for back-and-forth)
- Schedule conflicts don't allow for sync
- As a time savings (by not also doing sync) for processes that are setup to be async (ex. PR reviews)
- It's your strong preference not to have synchronous discussion

## Things I'm working on

- Mentally - Mindfulness and gratitude
- Physically - Consistently running 3-7 miles, 1-2 times per week and doing 10-20 min HIIT workouts 3-4 times per week
- Professionally - Learning more about the intersection of lean product design, architectural design patterns for software, and the impacts to team / company dynamics (specifically for tech startups)
- Inter-personally - Continuing to give the "benefit of doubt" but gaining clarity on intent earlier instead of letting things build up to the point where misunderstandings start impacting relationships
